# Release History

### v0.1 - Basic Release

This is just enough to get a clean "New Tab" without being annoyingly marketed to.

I gave it a simple linear gradient background and border from blue-ish to green
with a touch of yellow.  I may delve into options later for changing and customizing it a little.
