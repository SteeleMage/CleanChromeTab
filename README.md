# Installing

This version is not in the Chrome Web Store.  To install, you may download the ZIP file,
extract it, then back in Chrome:

- Click the kebab menu (three vertical dots) in the upper-right corner
- Choose "More tools..."
- Select "Extensions"
- Toggle the "Developer Mode" to on in the upper-right
- Click the "Load Unpacked" button that appeared
- Choose the folder you extracted the ZIP contents to
- You will now see "Steeles' Clean Chrome Tab 0.1" in the list of installed extensions
- Toggle the "Developer Mode" back off

Notes:

- You can always remove "Remove" the extension from this page
- You can also simply toggle it "Off" to disable it
- The first time you open a new tab with this on, it will notify you that "Steeles' Clean Chrome Tab" wants to change content, and asks if you want to allow it.  If you allow it, it will display the Blue-to-Green-to-Yellow gradient page.  It won't ask again.



# Release History

### v0.1 - Basic Release

This is just enough to get a clean "New Tab" without being annoyingly marketed to.

I gave it a simple linear gradient background and border from blue-ish to green
with a touch of yellow.  I may delve into options later for changing and customizing it a little.
